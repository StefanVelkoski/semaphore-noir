# Subgraph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a protocol for indexing networks like Ethereum and IPFS.
Site owners publish _subgraphs_ that expose site data for anyone to query.
Semaphore's subgraph allows you to retrieve data from the [`Semaphore.sol`](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/blob/feat/semaphore-v4/packages/contracts/contracts/Semaphore.sol) smart contract.

:::tip
The Graph protocol uses the [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) query language. For examples, see the [GraphQL API documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/developer/graphql-api). Visit the [Semaphore subgraph](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/tree/feat/semaphore-v4/apps/subgraph) to see the list of networks supported by Semaphore and its URLs.
